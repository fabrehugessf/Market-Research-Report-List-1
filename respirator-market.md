<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respirator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-purifying Respirators</li><li>Supplied-air Respirators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The respirator market encompasses two primary types: air-purifying respirators (APRs) and supplied-air respirators (SARs). APRs filter contaminants from the air, offering protection against particulates and gases, making them suitable for environments with limited hazardous exposure. In contrast, SARs deliver clean air from an external source, ensuring a continuous supply of breathable air in high-risk settings. Both types serve crucial roles in occupational safety, protecting users in industries like construction, healthcare, and chemical handling.</p></p>
