<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Area CMOS Image Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front Side Illuminated Area CMOS Image Sensors</li><li>Back Side Illuminated Area CMOS Image Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Area CMOS Image Sensors market is divided into two primary types: Front Side Illuminated (FSI) and Back Side Illuminated (BSI) sensors. FSI sensors capture light through the surface, making them cost-effective but less efficient in low-light conditions due to circuitry obstructing pixel area. In contrast, BSI sensors improve light absorption by placing circuitry behind the pixel array, enhancing performance in low-light environments and enabling higher resolution images. This distinction affects applications in consumer electronics, automotive, and industrial imaging.</p></p>
