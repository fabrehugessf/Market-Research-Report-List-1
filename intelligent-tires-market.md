<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring</li><li>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intelligent tires market comprises two primary types: Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring (TPMS) and Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring. Direct TPMS uses sensors placed in the tire to provide real-time pressure readings, enhancing accuracy and safety. In contrast, Indirect TPMS relies on the vehicle's anti-lock braking system to estimate tire pressure by monitoring wheel speed, making it a more economical option. Both systems aim to prevent under-inflation, improve fuel efficiency, and enhance overall driving performance.</p></p>
